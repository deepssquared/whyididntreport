A Preliminary Analysis on #WhyIDidntReport


On September 21, after Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault, survivors of sexual violence across the world started tweeting about why they didn’t report what had happened to them. This hashtag—#WhyIDidntReport—trended on twitter. 

One of the advantages of qualitative data is that it provides potential insights as to future policy recommendations. The hashtag #WhyIDidntReport illustrated systemic failures that—through proper analysis—can be viewed through a quality management perspective. The data raises potential questions: where is the status quo failing survivors? What gaps do policies need to address?

A limitation of data scraping from Twitter is that API keys are only released to approved developers. However, using the qualitative analysis software NVivo, I was able to scrape several tweets dated on September 21. I used a text mining package in R to pinpoint the top phrases in the tweets. This revealed a culture of blame surrounding sexual assault along with failings from existing justice systems such as the police.

I also mapped the tweets by geographic location to assess the sample population. Unsurprisingly, a large number of tweets were concentrated in North America. 

Ideally, I hope to scrape a larger sample to pinpoint trends in keywords over time, commonly used phrases, and potentially analyze these narratives with more meticulous detail.
